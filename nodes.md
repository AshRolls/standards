## Recomended setup for consensus nodes

#### Remote access
Remote access to machines should be restricted to SSH using public-key with physical Yubico 4/NEO keys.

#### Hardware
Nodes should not be run in shared machines for security concerns.
Prefered form is to run the nodes with colocation in high security datacenters like Deltalis, Equinix and A1 Arsenal. The hardware configurations for the IaaS providers below can serve as a guideline of expectations for 2018.

Since consensus nodes are the ones computing the network hardware requirements need to be reviewed periodically to guarantee that performance is optimal.

If colocation is not possible the recomended IaaS providers and configurations are listed bellow:

- [OVH EG-32](https://www.ovh.com/us/dedicated-servers/infra/1801eg02.xml)
  - CPU: Intel  Xeon E3-1270v6 - 4c/8t - 3.8GHz
  - RAM: 32GB DDR4 ECC 2133 MHz
  - SSD: softraid-1 2x450GB NVMe
  - NET: 1 Gbps
 
- [Packet Workhorse](https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/servers/type-1/)
  - CPU: IntelÂ® Xeon E3-1240v5 - 4c/8t - 3.5GHz
  - RAM: 32 GB DDR3 ECC 1333 MHz
  - SSD: softraid-1 2x120GB Enterprise SSD
  - NET: 2 x 1 Gbps Bonded
 
- [Liquidweb](https://cart.liquidweb.com/configure/single-processor-1275v6)
  - CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1275v6 - 4c/8t - 3.8GHz
  - RAM: 32 GB DDR4 ECC
  - SSD: softraid-1 2x240GB Enterprise SSD
  - NET: 2 x 1 Gbps Bonded
 
#### Passwords
Use a password manager to hold every password on this setup (Lastpass and Dashlane are recommended). All services should be setup with 2FA enabled and with physical keys when the option is disponible.

All passwords should be considered strong (use this [lastpass solution](https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php)).

## SSH authentication keys
Restricting SSH login to public keys make it as good as the keys protection, se we require the use of a physical OpenPGP SmartCard for SSH authentication. We recomend Yubikey 4.
For more about the habilities onf PGP on Yubikey refer to [official documentation](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/).

 - Full [Windows guide](https://developers.yubico.com/PGP/SSH_authentication/Windows.html)
 - Full [Linux/MacOS](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide)

Change the defaults Admin PIN from `12345678` and PIN from `123456` to secure memorized combinations.

After add to your key to the SmartCard enabled authentication agent, gpg-agent comes bundled in gpg2 - we recomend that.

## Service provider specific configuration:

On the provider firewall (outside OS settings) setup for block all and add exceptions to ports 22 and 10333 only.
If other services shared a account please be sure to place the consensus node in a anti-affinity group with isolated hypervisor.
 
## Linux server configuration
 
Every node needs 2 managers, located in different jurisdictions. Each should have a dedicated user able to login into the system and a third consensus user (not acessible by SSH) should be the only with access to the private keys for the consensus node.

on first login give a strong password to root, you will only need this if sudo password is lost (or to revoke those):
```shell
su (sudo su on Ubuntu)
passwd
```

### While still in su

update packages, Ubuntu:

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

CentOS:

```shell
yum update
```

add manager users (repeat for both managers):

```shell
useradd canesin
mkdir /home/canesin
mkdir /home/canesin/.ssh
chmod 700 /home/canesin/.ssh
```

This guide is based on bash so set that as prefered shell for the manager

```shell
usermod -s /bin/bash canesin
```

Copy the public key of Yubikey public key from `ssh-add -L` of managers into authorized_keys

```shell
vim /home/canesin/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Setup permissions:

```shell
chmod 400 /home/canesin/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown canesin:canesin /home/canesin -R
```

setup a password for managers (this will be sudo passwords)

```shell
passwd canesin
```

Now we will setup sudo for managers, add `%sudo` goupd and comment with `#` any other group that is not `root`.

```shell
visudo
```

The file should look like:

```shell
# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of
# directly modifying this file.
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
#
Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"

# Host alias specification

# User alias specification

# Cmnd alias specification

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
#%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:

#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

add managers to sudo group

```shell
usermod -aG sudo canesin
```

you will need to login and logout from manager account to update it

```shell
su -l canesin
exit
```

Back as su now lock SSH loging to public key and managers only

```shell
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

This lines should be added/modified, add all managers separated by space in AllowUsers

```shell
X11Forwarding no
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers canesin
```

Add user to run consensus node
```shell
useradd consensus
mkdir /home/consensus
```

Create a strong password for consensus, this should be shared in a secure way bettew managers
```shell
passwd consensus
```

Last step as su is to reboot ssh, after that login back as a manager.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

### While logged as manager

#### Firewall

First thing is to install firewall and lockdown the node, on Debian (Ubuntu):

```shell
sudo apt-get install ufw
```

On CentOS:

```shell
yum install epel-release
yum install ufw
```

Set IPV6 to yes in `vim /etc/default/ufw` and allow only the ports 22 and 10333:

```shell
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 10333
sudo ufw disable
sudo ufw enable
```

#### Automatic security updates

##### On Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
```

update to match:

```shell
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";
```

Now disable non security automatic updates

```shell
sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
```

update so that the only uncommented lines are:

```shell
Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {   
    "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}";
    "${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";        
    "${distro_id}ESM:${distro_codename}";
};
```

##### On CentOS:

Install yum-cron and enable it for security packges

```shell
sudo yum -y install yum-cron
sudo systemctl start yum-cron
sudo systemctl enable yum-cron
sudo nano /etc/yum/yum-cron.conf
```

Now change it to match:

```shell
update_cmd = security
apply_updates = yes
emit_via = email
email_to = YOUR_EMAIL_TO_RECEIVE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATIONS
```

on email_to insert the email you want to be warned when updates occur.

#### fail2ban

Now we will install fail2ban, a tool that ban IPs in iptables that have suspicious behaviour. It has sane defaults, so just installing is enough. On Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```

On CentOS:

```shell
yum install fail2ban
```

#### 2 Factor Authentication

2FA combined with physical OpenPGP keys for SSH makes for a very strong auth setup. On Ubuntu install it using:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator
```

On CentOS (with epel enabled - see above):

```shell
sudo yum install google-authenticator
```

After installing follow the instructions when running the command as manager, (anwser as y/y/y/n/y), do this as both managers first, as we will update PAM to require the 2FA after this step

```shell
google-authenticator
```

No edit the SSH configuration to require the 2FA setup:

```shell
sudo vim /etc/pam.d/sshd
```

Add the following line at the end of the file

```shell
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Comment out the line about password prompt, on Ubuntu:

```shell
# Standard Un*x authentication.
#@include common-auth
```

on CentOS:

```shell
#auth       substack     password-auth
```

Edit the sshd_config file to require the 2FA challenge

```shell
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Edit file to allow challange and add line with auth methods:

```shell
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
AuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive
```

now restart SSHD service

```shell
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

Without closing your current SSH session open another window and try to login to confirm that the setup is working correctly.

#### Monitoring

Monitoring a consensus node is very important to spot issues and help improve the NEO project. We will install netdata and access it only by a SSH tunnel (we keep the firewall blocking setup).

Install the pre-built static version (to reduce attack surface and not have unneeded dependencies):

```shell
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh)
```

To access the create a SHH tunnel and open a browser to localhost:19999

```shell
ssh -f canesin@159.100.252.102 -L 19999:159.100.252.102:19999 -N
```
